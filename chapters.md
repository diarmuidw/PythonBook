# Python Programming for Beginners by Diarmuid Wrenne et AI

## Prologue
Python Programming for Beginners is a comprehensive guide that will help you learn the basics of Python programming language from scratch. This book is ideal for individuals who have no prior experience in programming and want to start their journey in Python programming.

The book covers everything from installing Python on your computer to understanding the basic syntax of the language. You'll learn how to write simple programs and work with variables, loops, and conditional statements. The book also covers more advanced topics such as functions, classes, and object-oriented programming.

With this book, you'll also learn how to work with Python's built-in libraries and modules, as well as how to install and use third-party libraries. You'll also learn how to write code that interacts with files and databases.

Throughout the book, you'll find practical examples and exercises to help you reinforce your learning. Additionally, the book includes tips and tricks to help you avoid common mistakes and pitfalls in Python programming.

Whether you're looking to learn Python programming for a new job, to enhance your existing skills, or just for fun, Python Programming for Beginners is the perfect resource to help you get started.

Tight lines (A fishing expression but it works for code too!)

## A Confesssion

Nearly every line of this book was written by OpenAI.  I asked it to outline a 10 chapter book on python programming and then wrote code to take the outline and called the API to generate the chapters.

The text and code are sound and are good enough to get a newbie started. It's a very small window into the future of content creation. 

This could be used to "write" books on more specific areas such as REST API programming, general web programming, webrtc development, etc. I expect that these will require more tailoring of prompts, intervention and quality control.
