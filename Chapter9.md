# Basics of Data Science with Python

Python is widely used in data science due to its simplicity and flexibility. In this section, we will cover the basics of data science using Python.

## Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib Libraries

Numpy is a library in Python used for scientific computing. It provides a number of features for performing complex mathematical operations on large sets of data. For example, let's say we want to calculate the average of ten numbers. We could do it manually as follows:

```python
num_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
total = 0
for num in num_list:
    total += num
average = total / len(num_list)
print(average)
```

Alternatively, we could use the `numpy` library to achieve the same result in just one line of code:

```python
import numpy as np

num_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
average = np.mean(num_list)
print(average)
```

Pandas is another popular library in Python used for data science, particularly for working with structured data. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. For example, let's say we have a CSV file containing data on different cars. We can use the `pandas` library to easily read in the data and manipulate it:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('cars.csv')
print(data.head())
```

Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python used for creating charts and graphs. It provides a variety of plot types, including line, bar, scatter, and pie charts. For example, let's say we want to plot the sales data for a company over a period of six months. We can use the `matplotlib` library to create a simple line chart:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June']
sales = [1200, 1450, 1900, 2200, 2500, 2800]

plt.plot(months, sales)
plt.title('Sales Data')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales')
plt.show()
```

## Data Analysis

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information. Python provides a number of libraries for data analysis, including `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, and `statsmodels`. These libraries can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple data manipulation to advanced statistical modeling.

For example, let's say we want to analyze the relationship between a person's age and their income. We can use the `pandas` library to read in a CSV file containing this data, and then use `matplotlib` to create a scatter plot of the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = pd.read_csv('income_data.csv')
plt.scatter(data['age'], data['income'])
plt.title('Age vs Income')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Income')
plt.show()
```

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of study that uses algorithms and statistical models to enable systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Python provides a number of libraries for machine learning, including `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, and `keras`.

For example, let's say we want to build a machine learning model to predict the price of a house based on its features, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. We can use the `scikit-learn` library to split our data into training and testing sets, train a regression model on the training data, and then evaluate its performance on the testing data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

data = pd.read_csv('housing_data.csv')

X = data[['bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft']]
y = data['price']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(score)

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a method of teaching computers to identify patterns in data and make decisions based on those patterns. Python has become a popular language for machine learning tasks due to its simplicity, readability, and the abundance of powerful libraries available.

### Types of Machine Learning

There are three main types of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

#### Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on labeled data. This means that the data has a known output or target variable. The algorithm learns to predict the target variable based on the input variables. Examples of supervised learning include classification and regression.

For instance, a supervised learning algorithm can be trained on data from e-commerce websites to predict if a customer will make a purchase or not. The algorithm can learn from features such as past purchase history, demographics, and the time spent on the website.

#### Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data. This means that the data does not have a target variable. The algorithm learns to identify patterns in the data without any guidance.

For example, unsupervised learning can be used to cluster customers based on their browsing behavior on an e-commerce website. The algorithm can identify groups of customers that have similar browsing patterns.

#### Reinforcement Learning

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. The algorithm receives rewards or punishments for each action it takes. Over time, the algorithm learns to take actions that maximize the reward.

A classic example of reinforcement learning is training an algorithm to play a game. The algorithm receives a positive reward for winning and a negative reward for losing. Over time, the algorithm learns to take actions that increase its chances of winning.

### Applying Machine Learning with Python

Python provides numerous libraries for machine learning, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. These libraries provide a variety of algorithms for different types of machine learning tasks.

For example, scikit-learn provides algorithms for classification, regression, and clustering tasks. TensorFlow is a popular library for deep learning tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing. Keras is a high-level library that simplifies the process of building and training neural networks.

In conclusion, machine learning is a powerful technique for making predictions and identifying patterns in data. Python provides a wealth of libraries and tools to make it easy to apply machine learning to your own projects.
